# Frontend

## Styles

All styles are contained in [Tailwind Plugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) to easily adapt on core style changes. Take a look at the [`button`](../../resources/js/tailwind/button.js) plugin for an easy example.

## Blade Components

The contained authentication forms are built with [Blade Components](https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade#components).

## Laravel-Mix

There is a new `manifest('css/app.css')` helper which replaces the `mix()` function.
